## About  
darkwire is an open-source communication suite focused on decentralization, privacy, and resilience—especially in constrained or adversarial environments. It's currently maintained by a solo developer [(me!)](https://github.com/cyb3r17). It uses LoRa (long range) radio mesh networks to enable cross border wan based communications.

Contributions—whether code, testing, feedback, or ideas—are always welcome. donations help sustain development, but are entirely optional.
